    The macro overview page shows an overview of the most common cancer cases across the US. It studies trends of cancer incidence rates (cases / 100,000) across years 2010 till 2019. It then presents the death rates (as a percentage) for each cancer type (within 5 years of diagnosis). According to the above presented results, Severity of each cancer type is calculated as: Incidence Rate (at year 2019) x percentage increase (from 2010 to 2019) x Death rate. The cancer with the highest severity value is then studied in details in the second page.
